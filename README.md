# 🔐 Cryptography Flutter App
A Flutter-based mobile application that demonstrates the encryption and decryption of plaintext using three classic cryptographic algorithms: Vernam Cipher, Rail Fence Cipher, and Vigenere Cipher.

# Algorithms Implemented

## 1. Vernam Cipher

Type: Symmetric, One-Time Pad

Encryption: Modular addition of plaintext and random key.

Decryption: Modular subtraction using the same key.

Key: Random key of the same length as plaintext.

## 2. Rail Fence Cipher

Type: Transposition Cipher

Encryption: Zigzag writing and reading across rails.

Decryption: Reconstruct rails and read zigzag.

Input: Number of rails.

## 3. Vigenere Cipher

Type: Polyalphabetic Substitution

Encryption: Shifts letters based on key values.

Decryption: Reverses shifts using the same key.

Key: Repeated to match length of plaintext.

# 🚀 Features

Clean and minimal UI built with Flutter.

Supports both encryption and decryption.

Real-time result generation on button click.

Random key generation for Vernam Cipher.

Smooth navigation between screens.

## Fully offline functionality — no internet required.

⚠️Though this was a team project in name, the actual implementation—including coding, cipher logic, and UI, clean code — was fully handled by me.
